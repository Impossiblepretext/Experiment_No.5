# Experiment_No.5 Implementation of Set and Dictionary in Python
## Title
Implementation of Set and Dictionary in Python

## Aim
To study and implement set data structure in Python and perform various set and Dictionary operations.

## Objectives
To understand the concept of sets
To perform set creation and basic operations
To apply mathematical set operations
To understand dictionary structure
To perform insertion, deletion, and access of data
To apply dictionary methods
Theory: Sets
A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are defined using curly braces {} or the set() constructor.

## Characteristics of Set
Unordered: Elements do not have a defined sequence or index.
No duplicate elements: Only unique items are stored.
Mutable: The set can be modified after creation.
No Indexing: Sets do not support access via index positions.
Mathematical Set Operations
Union (|): Combines elements from both sets.
Intersection (&): Identifies elements common to both sets.
Difference (-): Identifies elements in the first set but not the second.
Symmetric Difference (^): Identifies elements in either set, but not both.
Theory: Dictionary
A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, while values may be duplicated.

## Characteristics of Dictionary
Key-value based: Data is stored and accessed via unique keys.
Mutable: The dictionary structure can be modified after creation.
Unique Keys: Each key acts as a unique identifier.
Modifiable Values: Values associated with keys can be updated or changed.
Set Operations
Union
Intersection
Difference
Symmetric Difference
Applications of Set
Removing duplicate records
Membership testing
Mathematical computations
Theory on dictionary
A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, while values may be duplicated.

Syntax: dictionary = {key: value} Dictionaries are widely used in real-life applications such as student records, phone books, and configuration data.

Characteristics of Dictionary
Key-value based
Mutable
Keys are unique
Values can be modified
Applications of Dictionary
Student information systems
Phone directories
Database records
Configuration files
## Conclusion
Sets efficiently handle unique data and support mathematical operations, making them useful for data processing tasks. Dictionaries provide efficient storage and retrieval of data using keys, making them essential for real-world applications.
